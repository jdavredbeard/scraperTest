# scraperTest
A tester program- my first web scraper, using jSoup to scrape html from the craigslist homepage and parse it into a Document object, and JDBC to pass the collected data into MySQL.<br>
Note: This project uses environment variables to get the User, Password, and Host values for logging into MySQL. You can set these on your own system by setting the $MYSQL_USER, $MYSQL_PW, and $MYSQL_HOST environmental variables to the appropriate values.
